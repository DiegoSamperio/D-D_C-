# Dungeons & Dragons Game in C++

## Overview
This project is a C++ implementation of a Dungeons & Dragons-inspired game where players can choose from three races: Elf, Human, or Dwarf. Each race has unique abilities, and the player will explore dungeons, encounter monsters, and use various skills to defeat them.

The game offers a text-based interactive experience, where the player can:
- Select a race and customize the character
- Roll dice to enter random dungeons
- Fight different monsters
- Use unique race-based skills such as healing, damage, and shield abilities
- Defeat monsters and track progress

## Features
- **Race Selection**: Choose between Elf, Human, or Dwarf, each with unique skills.
- **Dungeon Exploration**: Randomly generated dungeons based on dice rolls.
- **Combat System**: Turn-based combat where players can roll dice and use skills.
- **Skill System**: Each race has different abilities for healing, damaging enemies, or protecting with shields.
- **Monster Defeating**: Monsters have different stats and can be defeated to progress through the game.
